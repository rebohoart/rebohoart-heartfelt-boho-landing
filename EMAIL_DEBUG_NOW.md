## üîß SOLUTIONS FOR COMMON PROBLEMS

### Problem: Emails go to SPAM

**Temporary solution:**
1. Check SPAM/Junk folder
2. Mark email as "Not spam"
3. Add sender to contacts

**Permanent solution:**
- Gmail generally doesn't go to spam when sending from Gmail domain itself
- If it continues, consider using a service like Resend or SendGrid

---

### Problem: "Order sent successfully" but don't receive email

**Possible causes:**

1. **Email is in SPAM**
   - Check SPAM folder

2. **STORE_EMAIL incorrect**
   - Check the `STORE_EMAIL` secret in Supabase
   - Confirm the email exists and is accessible

3. **Gmail temporarily blocked**
   - Gmail has a limit of 500 emails per day
   - If exceeded, wait 24h

**How to verify:**
1. Go to Edge Function logs
2. Look for: `"‚úì Email sent successfully"`
3. If it appears, email was sent (check SPAM)
4. If it doesn't appear, see error in logs

---

### Problem: Can't create App Password

**Cause:** 2-Step Verification is not active or hasn't propagated.

**Solution:**
1. Enable 2-Step Verification: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Wait 10-15 minutes
3. Log out and log back into Google
4. Try creating App Password again
